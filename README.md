# Assignment 03

**Course Title**: Web Development

**Course Code**: IRM1005 / ITEC1005

**Semester**: Fall 2023

**Due Date**: 11:59 PM on November 12, 2023

**Assessment**: This assignment is worth 15% of your final grade and marked out of 100.

## TLDR

1. Initialise an array and complete the five functions in the `index.js` file.
2. Run the automated tests and view results in the console.
3. Commit your code to your assignment repository in GitHub.
4. Turn on GitHub Pages in your repository to host your web page online.

## Description

This assignment will assess your ability to write basic javascript, including variable decleration, array manipulation, function creation, and using `console.log()` to output data to the console.

Students will also be assessed on their ability to commit their code to GitHub and activate the GitHub pages service.

Create and host a web page that meets the following requirements:

- Follow all instructions provided in the `index.js` file to complete the assignment
- Initialise an array of todo items
- Complete the five functions in the `index.js` file
- Do not modify the automated test file in any way
- Run the automated tests to ensure your code is working correctly
- No errors should be present 
- All tests should pass
- To be awarded an A, you need add some error checking in your functions, this means adding code in your functions to check if the user input is garbage (like trying to delete a todo ID that doesn't exist, or trying to create a todo by passing a number instead of a string)
- You must use the GitHub Repository generated by GitHub Classrooms for the assignment
- Web page must be hosted using GitHub Pages service
- Web page must be reachable by a browser on the public internet
